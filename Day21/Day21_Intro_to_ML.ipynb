    "Machine Learning is a way of teaching computers to learn patterns from data instead of giving them fixed rules. In traditional programming, we give data and instructions, and the computer produces results. In Machine Learning, we give data and correct answers, and the computer finds the rules by itself. These learned rules are then used to make predictions on new data."
